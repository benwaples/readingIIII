> The purpose of Architectural Patterns is to understand how the major parts of the system fit together and how messages and data flow through the system.

* architectural patterns are high-level and encompassing of the whole app. Design patterns are of a specific code section.

* architectural styles are different from patterns, the style is the name given to the reoccurring architectural patterns.

> An Idiom is a low-level pattern specific to a programming language.

### layers
Most of the time we have 4 layers:
* Presentation layer or UI layer
* Application layer or Service layer
* Business logic layer or Domain layer
* Data access layer or Persistence layer

MVC is an layered design.

### Event-Driven(EDA)
Designed around the events. Emmitters know the event has happened, a consumer just needs to know an event has occured and it will consume the event. 

* Often used in async operations and UIs.
